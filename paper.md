# Introduction

We propose to develop a library that focuses on methods that apply machine learning to biomedical ontologies. The methods can be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) graph-based methods that transform ontologies into graphs and apply graph-based machine learning methods; (2) syntactic methods which learn from axioms and textual information in the ontologies; (3) semantic methods which learn from OWL semantics of the ontologies directly. A number of ontology-based machine learning methods have been reviewed and evaluated in a recent paper (https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa199/5922325). The aim of the project is to develop an easy-to-use library and toolkit where users can apply these methods to their biological and biomedical ontologies and associated data. The library will be available as an open-source project.
